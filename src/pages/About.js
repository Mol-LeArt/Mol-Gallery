            <p>Humans are creative creatures, we use our brains to dream up fantastical and impossible things. Artists bring these things to life through mediums like paintings, music, writing, and more. Many of our favorite stories and memories are because of art. We love these things so much we’re willing to pay for them, sometimes at tremendous valuations.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>The problem is, art has traditionally been guarded by gatekeepers, the middlemen like galleries and brokers which offer little to no transparency when art gets sold and resold. As a result, when art is sold at higher and higher multiples, artists don’t get a piece of those profits. The phrase “starving artist” is a stereotype that is often associated with creatives but it doesn’t have to be this way.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>At Mol LeArt, artists are able to tokenize their work and retain a number of controls pertaining to how the token is used, even after it is sold. Our goal is to expand the set of controls available to artists so that they no longer need to rely on third parties to engage in commercial activities. Like putting a pilot in the cockpit with different switches and knobs for controlling the direction of an aircraft, Mol puts the power back in the hands of the artists.</p>
