          Mol LeArt is building creative commons for Web3 communities, where
          communities may one-click spin up a marketplace (a.k.a commons), and
          manage the marketplace in a DAO setting. The commons take the form of
          a smart contract with governance mechanism baked in so that
          communities may collectively manage their creative assets. Examples of
          governance mechanism include multisig access, NFT management, fee
          distribution, etc.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The creative commons may be used by small communities like bands,
          medium sized communities like galleries, and large communities like
          corporations. For example, bands may mint NFTs to the commons as
          individual songs/NFTs for sale, manage and sell the commons as an
          album, control contribution to the commons, etc. The same may be
          applied to galleries for managing creative works produced by resident
          artists, as well as corporations for managing intellectual property
          like copyright, patents, etc.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Our goal is to help communities create, manage, and profit from NFTs
          collectively. We believe, through on-chain governance and strength in
          numbers, communities can build sustainable stream of income that'd
          ultimately flow back to the creators!
